# Project Reactor Hands-On Learning

Welcome to my hands-on learning repository for Project Reactor in Java! This repository contains my journey of exploring reactive programming concepts through practical examples and exercises using Project Reactor.

## 📌 About

This repository is my personal learning space where I experiment with Project Reactor, a foundational library for building reactive applications on the JVM. Here, I document my progress through various reactive programming concepts, from basic to advanced.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- Basic reactive streams with `Flux` and `Mono`
- Operators and transformations
- Backpressure handling
- Error handling strategies
- Testing reactive streams
- Advanced topics like combining publishers, hot vs cold publishers, etc.
- Practical examples and use cases

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To work with the examples in this repository, you'll need:

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Basic understanding of Java and functional programming concepts
- (Optional) IDE with Java support (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek-shrestha224/java-reactive-programming.git
   cd project-reactor-learning
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## 📚 Learning Path

The repository is organized by concepts, with each having its own package and examples:

1. **Core Concepts**
   - Hello World with Reactor
   - Flux vs Mono
   - Subscribing to Publishers

2. **Operators**
   - Transformation operators (map, flatMap)
   - Filtering operators (filter, take, skip)
   - Combining operators (merge, zip, concat)

3. **Advanced Topics**
   - Backpressure strategies
   - Schedulers and threading
   - Hot vs Cold Publishers
   - Testing with StepVerifier

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, I welcome suggestions, corrections, or additional examples that could help others learn Project Reactor. Feel free to open issues or pull requests!
